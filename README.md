# 1-D-Time-Domain-Convolution-on-FPGA
 In this project a FPGA is programmed to perform 1-D time domain convolution using VHDL. It consists of two major  parts to be completed which were the DMA interface between memory(DRAM) and the user_app and the design oof the signal  and kernel buffers to perform convolution.
